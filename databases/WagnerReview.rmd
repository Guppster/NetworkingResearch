## Jot notes

### Abstract
- Forensics needs to be effective on databases that are configured incorrectly
  and have no protection techniques integrated in them. Sometimes they don't
  even have logging
- Paper talks about a tool called DBCarver. 
- Reconstructs database context from a database image without using any log or
  system data.
- Uses page carving to reconstruct both query-able data and deleted data.
- Allows investigators to conduct new types of analysis on the data

### Introduction
- Since most large applications use databases, large scale cyber crime almost
  always involves databases.
- A related concept is file carving, which retrieves files from storage on
  a file system even if they are deleted or corrupted
- Relational databases store data in pages
- We can reconstruct pages to retrieve data
- Targets extracting data maintained by the running database instead of
  recovering original
- Paper considers two scenarios, database is good or bad

### Contribution and Related Work

- Explain Page carving
- Describe how to do sql analysis on data to solve real-world forensic problems
- Evaluate performance of the tool itself
- Other people have done work to prevent and detect database tampering but not
  much has been done to actively reconstruct data from a damaged database to
  find evidence
- Many other methods assume logs and detection mechanisms exist and leverage
  those to conduct an analysis which is not always possible in a real-world
  scenario
- This system leverages the fact that the metadata associated with the real
  data isn't present but the data is still in good condition.
