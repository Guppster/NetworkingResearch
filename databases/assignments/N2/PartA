## Question 1

### LAB 2 DIY Question A

SELECT DISTINCT Name, Course_number as Course,
  IFNULL(Prerequisite_number, '') as Prerequisite FROM student
  JOIN grade_report USING (Student_number)
  JOIN section USING (Section_identifier)
  JOIN course USING (Course_number)
LEFT JOIN prerequisite USING (Course_number)
ORDER BY Name ASC, course ASC;

### LAB 2 DIY Question B

SELECT CONCAT_WS(' : ', Course_number, Course_name) as course,
  CONCAT_WS(' : ', prerequisite.Prerequisite_number, prerequisite_name) as prerequisite
FROM course
LEFT JOIN prerequisite USING (Course_number)
LEFT JOIN(
    SELECT Course_name as prerequisite_name, Course_number as Prerequisite_number from course
) temp on prerequisite.Prerequisite_number = temp.Prerequisite_number


## Question 2

### course table

Attributes:
course_name, course_number, credit_hours, department

Functional Dependencies: 
course_name -> course_number
course_number -> department, course_name, credit_hours

Candidate Keys:
(course_name)+ = course_name, course_number, department, credit_hours
(course_number)+ = course_name, course_number, department, credit_hours

Therefore both course_name and course_number are candidate keys

This table has no unnesscessary attributes. 
It is in 1NF because each attribute is atomic.
It is in 2NF because each attribute is dependent on a key.
It is in 3NF because there are no transitive dependencies
It is in BCNF because all keys are also candidate keys

### grade_report table

Attributes: 
student_number, section_identifier, grade

Functional Dependencies:
section_identifer, student_number -> grade

Candidate Keys: 
(section_identifier)+ = section_identifier
(student_number)+ = student_number

Therefore the candidate key is (section_number, student_number)

Since the functional dependency key is the candidate key the table is in BCNF.

### pre-requisite table

Attributes: 
course_number, prerequisite_number

Functional Dependencies:
course_number -> prerequisite_number

Candidate Keys:
(course_number)+ = course_number, prerequisite_number

Therefore the candidate key is course_number

Since the functional dependency key is the candidate key the table is in BCNF.

### section table

Attributes:
section_identifier, course_number, semester, year, instructor

Functional Dependencies:
section_identifier -> course_number, semester, year, instructor

Candidate Keys:
(section_identifier)+ = section_identifier, course_number, semester, year, instructor

Therefore the candidate key is section_identifier

Since the functional dependency key is the candidate key the table is in BCNF.

### student table

Attributes:
name, student_number, class, major

Functional Dependencies:
student_number -> name, class, major

Candidate Keys:
(student_number)+ = student_number, name, class, major

Therefore the candidate key is student_number

Since the functional dependency key is the candidate key the table is in BCNF.
