# Securing NoSQL databases using blockchains

### Introduction (1-2 paragraphs)

The contents of a modern production database should be secure and interactions
should be easily verifiable. We would like to propose a solution that strengthens
the security of modern NoSQL databases using bleeding edge blockchain solutions.

In current database management software, the only way to verify the
interactions that occur within a database is checking the log created by the
system. The problem is that logging can easily be disabled or reduced to
a level where malicious actions could occur without leaving a trace. 

The solution we are proposing is to use hashing to capture the active state of
a Mongo database and use an Ark blockchain to verify it's integrity. We would
like to be able to specify a query resulting in a set of documents, the result
will then be hashed and stored on the blockchain to a corresponding address.
This functionality could then be automated to check the database's secured
queries periodically to effectively secure it.

### Motivation (1-3 paragraphs)

    What is the history of the problem?

    Why is this problem interesting?

    When and why does the problem occur?

    Is the problem already solved? What is done now?

    Are there any similar systems or solutions to the one you propose? If so, reference and very briefly explain them.

    Are there are possible improvements to current solutions?

    Where / how your solution will be used?

### Project Details (2-3 paragraphs design, 3-5 paragraphs deliverables)

We would like to design this project as a command line utility which allows the
user to easily hash and validate the contents of a Mongo database running on
the local machine. The project will consist of a Mongo database and a local
deployment of an Ark blockchain. Unless complications come up with the
platform, we are planning on using the Ruby language to develop the command
line utility. Since we are using Ruby, we will be using the open source
ark-ruby library to interact with the Ark blockchain and the official ruby
mongodb driver to interact with the database.

The system will work by first prompting the user for a query to obtain a set of
documents. The set of documents will then be hashed and a corresponding address
on the Ark blockchain will be allocated for this query. The hash will of the
set will be pushed in the form of a transaction to that specific address from
a central blockchain management address (BCMA) which will act as one of the
forging delegates and therefore always have funds to process the transaction.
The transaction ID returned from the blockchain interaction will be stored back
into the database in a control document storing the state of each secured set
of documents so later on we can validate against this.

In this project we would like to deliver the functionality to manually make
manually validate queries and detect tampering. The final deliverable will be
the command line utility allowing the user to seamlessly interact with the
entire system. If time permits, as an optional component, we would continue to
integrate the validation system into the database and allow for automatic
tamper detection. Another optional task which could be implemented in the
future is the ability to secure all documents, not just the queries specified
by the user. This project will contribute a system that is capable of utilizing
the cryptographic power of blockchains to secure a locally stored traditional
database. It provides a unique approach in between a fully blockchain based
data storage and a NoSQL database.
