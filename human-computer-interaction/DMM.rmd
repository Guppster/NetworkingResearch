## Reading is Unnatural

### Wired for Language not Reading

We are born to speak languages and learn to speak quickly in our childhood but
when we get older it is as difficult as any other skill A different brain area
is used for this type of learning after childhood. Most people learn how to
speak but some people never learn how to read. People may not be good at
reading because of {basically my problems irl}

Reading is teaching our brains how to recognize patterns. Morphemes are
combinations of letters we recognize and put together to make words

### Feature driven vs context driven

Feature driven is bottom up and sometimes called "context free". It starts by
identifying simple features like lines and uses them to make complex objects
like words. This type of reading is faster than context driven despite
instinct.

Context driven is top down and opposite of feature driven. You recognize
a morpheme, word or sentence and treat it like a single object to get it's
meaning. An example of this is something you would read often. Mainly a backup
method for reading.

### Skilled vs Unskilled reading

"Skilled readers" use feature driven mostly and fallback to context driven
"Unskilled readers" use context driven because feature driven is slow for them.

Not enough experience reading as a child causes unskilled reading

### Poor information design disprupts reading

Poor presentation can block reading for unskilled readers. The following are
things that disrupt reading:

- Uncommon words
- Difficult scripts and typefaces 
- Tiny Fonts
- Text on noisy background
- Visual noise from too much text
- Centered text is hard for eyes to follow

Any combination of the above can make for a very unreadable design Support both
reading styles by avoiding the problems listed above.

### Most reading is unnecessary

Most software has too much text in the instructions and people don't read it
anyway. You can be just as clear with less text. Provide a brief overview and
let users request more detail if they want.

## Our Color Vision is Limited

### Optimized for Edge Contrast

We can see something better if it is high contrast and brightness isn't as important

### Discrimination based on Presentation

The paler (less saturated) two colors are, the harder it is to tell them apart

The smaller and thinner objects are, the harder it is to distinguish their colors

The more separated color patches are, the more difficult it is to distinguish their colors

### Color-Blindness

Converting an image to grayscale can help you design applications for color blind people

### External Factors

Each color display can show something different just because of the technology.
Grayscale displays can also have this problem.
Display angle can make different images look different. TN panels lol.
Ambient illumination can wash out colors, enough to make color displays into grayscale

### Guidelines for using Color

- Distinguish colors by saturation and brightness as well as hue, avoid subtle color differences
- Use distinctive colors, increase contrast
- Avoid color pairs that color-blind people cannot distinguish
- Use color redundantly with other hues
- Separate string opponent colors
