# Chapter 10

## Learning From Experience

### Three Brains

The old brain categorizes everything into edible, dangerous, or sexy and
regulates the body's automatic functions. The mid brain controls emotions and
reactions to events. The new brain controls conscious activity including
planning.

actions. The old brain and mid brain react faster than the new brain.
